# Hello Agent

The code on the left greets an agent and displays a custom message depending on the agent's name. We are always expecting Charlie, but any other agent is quite the surprise! Replace the underscores with the keywords required for the code to run.

## Task

Fix the code by filling in the gaps. Test the code on the left by pressing the `Debug` button on the top. To reset the challenge, press the `reset` button.
