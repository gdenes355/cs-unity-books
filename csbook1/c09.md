# PIN verifying

At the Perse school there has recently been a lot of fraud occurring, specifically in the PAC card reader. There is an error in the school system that means any code entered into the reader is accepted, and your job is to reject bad pins. The code on the left is the template for a PIN verifier. The code should enter __only 4 digit long pins__ and this pin __must contain only numbers__. Help the school finish the code.

## Task

Fix the code by filling in the gaps. Test the code on the left by pressing the `Debug` button on the top. To reset the challenge, press the `reset` button.
