# Times table

Write some code on the left based on the previous challenges that will input an integer number, then it prints out the corresponding times table.

E.g. if the input is `5`, the program will print
```text
1 x 5 = 5
2 x 5 = 10
3 x 5 = 15
4 x 5 = 20
5 x 5 = 25
6 x 5 = 30
7 x 5 = 35
8 x 5 = 40
9 x 5 = 45
10 x 5 = 50
11 x 5 = 55
12 x 5 = 60
```
