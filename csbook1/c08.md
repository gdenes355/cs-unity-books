# Case Reversing

The code on the left is the template for a function that inputs a string and returns the same string after switching the _case_ of all uppercase and lowercase characters, leaving numbers and symbols unchanged. For example: "HoW aRe yoU dOIng?" turns into "hOw ArE YOu DoiNG?".

## Task

Fix the code by filling in the gaps. Test the code on the left by pressing the `Debug` button on the top. To reset the challenge, press the `reset` button.
