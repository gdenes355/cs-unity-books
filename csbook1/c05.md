# Counting Part Two

The code on the left is the entire counter, started in the last challenge. It has the number to count up to and now the code must use repetition to count upwards.

## Task

Fix the code by filling in the gaps. Test the code on the left by pressing the `Debug` button on the top. To reset the challenge, press the `reset` button.

###Hints
This is a simple example of using a "while" loop to count upwards and `.ToString()` converts an `int` to a `string` and so the message should be sent to the console.
