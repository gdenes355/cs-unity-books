# Toaster Object Part 2

The code on the left defines a Toaster Object which has some properties, including its brand and power rating, along with some functions, like add_bread. We have added the Toast, Remove Bread and Show Slots functions to the previous code, along with some testing commands. Amend the code and see if it does what you are expecting.

## Task

Fix the code by filling in the gaps. Test the code on the left by pressing the `Debug` button on the top. To reset the challenge, press the `reset` button.
