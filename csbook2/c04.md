# Fruit Class Challenge

This code creates a plate of two fruits. They are given a name (we can call them whatever we want) and a colour (we can't magically change their colour). Convert these objects into classes in C# by filling in the blanks.

You might find [this section on W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cs/cs_oop.php) useful.

## Task

Fix the code by filling in the gaps. Test the code on the left by pressing the `Debug` button on the top. To reset the challenge, press the `reset` button.
